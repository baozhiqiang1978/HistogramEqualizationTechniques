# HistogramEqualizationTechniques
This has a few algorithms which are based on histogram equalisation to improve the contrast of the image.

## Histogram Equalisation
## Adaptive Histogram Equalisation
## Clipped Adaptive Histogram Equalisation

These methods are implemented. Some of the sample images are given in inputImages and their output figure is stored in outputImages. use `openfig()` in matlab to open the output figure. One can play around with the paraeters in *AHE* and *CLAHE* to see which one gives the best image.
